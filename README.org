* Org Project
  =org-project= compiles all of the =TODO=, =FIXME=, =NOTE= and =XXX=
  occurences from a project into a single org file (stored at the project root)
  with links to each of the occurences.

  =org-project= aims to play nicely with any other project management solutions
  you may already be using. You can create a =org-project= project out of an
  existing =projectile= project by running =org-project/create-project-from-projectile=.
